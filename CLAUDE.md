# Rules

- We arenot using supabase auth, we are using dynamic.xyz auth, so don't add any RLS, we will be handling them in application layer. 
- Use semantic classes in tailwindcss like `bg-primary`, `text-primary-500`, etc. 
- Use shadcn whenever and wherever possbile.
- Don't run the server, we already have the server running
